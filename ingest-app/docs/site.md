### <a name="redirects"></a> Redirects

The following redirects are defined in order to assist with a better organized documentation URL structure.

| --------------------------- | --------------------------- |------------------|
| /site/ingest_api_docs.html  | /site/docs/ingest/api.html  | `301`            |
| /site/docs/ingest/api       | /site/docs/ingest/api.html  | `307`            |
| /site/docs/ingest/site      | /site/docs/ingest/site.html | `307`            |

The permanent redirects have been added as means of providing backwards compatibility for users who have bookmarked the old URLs. The temporary redirects are provided in order to future-proof docs URL organization work. When that work is complete, the redirect locations will be updated status codes will be set to permanent.
