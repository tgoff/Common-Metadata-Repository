(ns cmr.spatial.tile
  "This contains functions to work with tiles defined in various 2D coordinate
  system grids such as Modis Integerized Sinusoidal Grid.

  The tile geometry is computed as necessary. Currently only computation of MODIS Sinusoidal tiles
  is implemented. Computation of tile coordinates for a Modis tile follows the steps below.
  (Please See: https://wiki.earthdata.nasa.gov/display/CMR/Computation+of+MODIS+Tile+Geometry)
  1) Map the tile to an equivalent tile in the upper-right quadrant(UR).
  2) Find if the mapped tile is a fictional tile or a real tile or a degenerate tile. Ignore
     fictional and degenerate tiles. Degenerate tiles have only one vertex which is a real point.
     All the remaining points of the tile are fictional points.
  3) Find the coordinates of the four vertices of the rectangle corresponding to the mapped tile.
  4) Densify each of the four segments of the tile mapped.
  5) Remove fictional points on each of the edges if there are any.
  6) Add the edge-point if the edge has fictional points on one side and real points on another.
  7) Map the densified points back to its original quadrant.
  8) Convert the points from planar coordinates to geodetic coordinates. Convert from radians to
     degrees."
